# AI HR APPLICATION

This is a project to learn about AI development flows and challenges. The goal of this project is to learn how to integrate AI into our common tools and use it to generate results that would otherwise require dedicated coded modules.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies using `pnpm i`
2. Start a local postgreSQL service and create a table called `ai-hr-app`
3. Run `pnpm drizzle-kit-push` to push the defined schema into your local postgreSQL database
4. Run `pnpm seed` to insert data into the database
5. Run `pnpm dev`
